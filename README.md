3. Go to repository Settings → Pages → Branch `main` / folder `/ (root)` → Save.

## SEO & ranking tips (get to page 1 faster)
1. Use strong keywords in title and meta description (already in `index.html`).
2. Create unique pages for main keywords: `/image-to-pdf`, `/merge-pdf`, `/compress-pdf` (copy same HTML and adjust H1/meta for each).
3. Add an XML sitemap and robots.txt (allow crawling).
4. Use social sharing — create Facebook/Twitter posts, submit to Reddit and Indian tech forums.
5. Create backlinks: post your site link in GitHub repo readme, producthunt, and developer communities.
6. Submit site to Google Search Console (verify site) and request indexing.
7. Publish a short blog post (on Medium or Dev.to) linking to your tool with the target keyword.
